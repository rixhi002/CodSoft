Conclusion:
In this Jupyter notebook project, we embarked on a journey to analyze and predict movie ratings. We encountered a variety of data challenges, such as missing values, typos in column names, and duplicated records. Through a series of data cleaning and preprocessing steps, we were able to prepare the dataset for analysis. Our analysis uncovered several interesting insights about the movie dataset. We observed trends in movie durations, genre popularity, the most prolific actors and directors, and the distribution of movie ratings and votes over the years. Notably, we found that short-duration movies tend to receive higher ratings and votes, and the Drama genre has consistently performed well in terms of ratings. Furthermore, our evaluation of machine learning models revealed that Random Forest outperformed Linear Regression, with an impressive R-squared score of 0.94 on unseen data, highlighting the model's robustness.

Insights:

Following are the main insights:

Data cleaning was essential, involving the correction of typos and handling missing/duplicated values.
We explored the temporal dimension of the data, noting the first entry in 1931 and a movie with just 45 minutes of duration.
Mithun is the most frequently appearing lead actor
We identified both the best and worst-performing movies in terms of votes and ratings.
Insights on directors with the most and least movies were gained.
The distribution of movies over the years is skewed, with a concentration in the 2015-2019 period.
In 2010, some movies had the highest average votes.

Short-duration movies tend to receive higher ratings and votes, indicating a potential preference for shorter films.

Drama is a consistently popular genre, while Comedy and Action genres had their origins in 1953 and 1964, respectively.
The distribution of ratings and votes follows Gaussian-like patterns, with specific peaks and trends over time.
Random Forest regression outperformed Linear Regression with an R-squared score of 0.94, indicating its robustness.
Through our analysis, we gained a deep understanding of the dataset and its trends. This knowledge can be leveraged to make informed decisions regarding movie production, genres, and more. Future work could involve building more advanced machine learning models or diving deeper into specific genres or time periods to uncover additional insights.
